#Purpose / Mission
-----------------
Disregarding discipline in multiple disciplines.
Humor/light-heartedness at the heart of the work, because it's enjoyable, it connects people, and it's powerful.

What is it that draws us to the Eames / Multi-Disciplinary work that we love so much?

Aesthetic?
Form?
Function?
Materials?

I think part of it is that, but I think a bigger part is all the marketing around it:
Something about the language and advertising (which are very much married to the products) that says:
- this is the future
- this is a frontier to be explored
- this is an exciting adventure to go on

Like when I look at an eames lounge, I hear a 1950’s/60’s father figure talking in my ear saying, “Behold this new uncharted territory!” “GO FORTH YOUNG MAN!” and I think of spaceships and constellations, not an image of a man sipping whiskey in front of a television.

(side note, I should stress that this "father figure voice" is probably a very important aspect of what drives the ideals, society was largely dominated by men, all of whom have spoken with this authoritative tone, you see it in every single video that we think is good, the powers video, the bell logo pitch, all of it has this manly voice speaking clearly and with authority, almost affected or put on, but sreassuring and comforting. I don't know exactly why, but I think it's important /end side note)

THAT’s the magic sauce. It’s that “attitude toward modern living” that is an enigma we need to crack. It’s the excitement of Mission Impossible / James Bond. I watched the newest Bond movie the other day and realized the whole thing is just one big ad for luxury products. I guess it always has been. But what is that magic? Is it that he is powerful and that you too will possess power by owning these things? Or is it the aesthetic & function of those things that evokes / gives him his power/coolness?

There is some yucky psychology in there that boils down to, drive a lamborghini, wear a watch that explodes, write with a fancy pen, and wear an expensive suit, and you will be able to vanquish any opponent / oppressor and have sex with any woman. It’s disgusting, when you boil it down, but people love it.

Maybe James Bond is a bad reference, or off-target, but he was used to sell all this stuff, as were many other figures. We can lump it all into “nostalgia” but I want to break that down and dissect it. I feel like modern design is constantly referencing the following, and I’ve noted the main psychological themes that I think underwrite each particular reference:

• military, scouts, spies 		=> Danger, Adventure, Conquest, Belonging
• fraternal orders, labor unions 	=> Belonging, Unity in experience, Brotherhood, Tribe mentality
• frontiers, the west, space, oceans 	=> Exploration, Adventure, Conquest
• science fiction, vision of future 	=> Experimentation, Learning, Fun, Power
• royalty / luxury 			=> Power, Victory, Success

There’s lots more to it, but I think it can boil down to these. What I want to do, is think about the feeling that we want to give people. I think the mid century stuff falls in the “Exploration, Experimentation, Power” zone of the brain.

I should probably start reading more about psychology, and I’ll end this rant now.

Let's found it on the Watts model: What would we do if money was no object or we got unlimited funding from someone/somewhere?
